This is a simple implementation of Expedia.com site.

In Expedia, a user will have several itineraries, each itinerary consisting of 0 or more flights and hotels.

An itinerary item will have its own cost and info. Itinerary cost is sum of all cost of internal items.

Also, local APIs are used to call for flights, hotels and payments.
